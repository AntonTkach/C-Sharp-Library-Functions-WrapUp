# C-Sharp-Library-Functions-WrapUp
A library that contains a wrap up of basic functions used in C#
Current version v0.2
Final version will be v1.0
This is especially for the porpose of using different class library than C# uses, but with the same syntax. Thus, when changes needed, I can manipulate only the functions and mehods that were wrappred up, without the need to rewrite and fix every instance of the usual Console library.

v0.2
Methods and their overloads: 

Beep
Clear
Read
ReadKey
ReadLine
ResetColor
SetBufferSize
SetCursorPosition
SetWindowPosition
SetWindowSize
Write
WriteLine

are already properly wrapped up
